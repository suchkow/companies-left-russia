### Languages & libraries <a name="lanslibs"></a>

We resorted to using Jupyter Notebook and Python 3.9+ in the course work.
Having the distribution of usage around 90% and 10% respectively.
Using Jupyter Notebook as the main source of our project allowed us
to quickly annotate code and make it more comprehensible.

Used Python's libraries are listed below:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno) - provides a small toolset of flexible and easy-to-use missing data visualizations and utilities that allows you to get a quick visual summary of the completeness (or lack thereof) of your dataset
- [beautifulsoap](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest) - library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
- [kmodes](https://pypi.org/project/kmodes/) - Python implementations of the k-modes and k-prototypes clustering algorithms. Relies on numpy for a lot of the heavy lifting. K-modes is used for clustering categorical variables.

### Works & articles <a name="worksarts"></a>

We used many of sources that helped us to make work correct and more professional.
